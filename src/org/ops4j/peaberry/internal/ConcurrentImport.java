/**
 * Provide an {@link Import} that dynamically delegates to the best service but
 * also tracks its use (even across multiple threads) so that unget() is always
 * called on the same service handle as get() was originally.
 * 
 * The solution below uses the same handle until no threads are actively using
 * the injected instance. This might keep a service in use for a little longer
 * than expected when there is heavy contention, but it doesn't require use of
 * any thread locals or additional context stacks.
