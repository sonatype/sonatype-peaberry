  <name>peaberry - dynamic service extension for Google-Guice</name>

  <url>http://code.google.com/p/peaberry/</url>

  <description>
    The peaberry project is an extension library for Google-Guice
    that supports dependency injection of dynamic services.

    It provides OSGi integration out of the box, and has plug-in
    support for other registry-based service frameworks. It ships
    as an OSGi bundle that can be dropped into any R4 framework,
    such as Apache Felix or Eclipse/Equinox.
